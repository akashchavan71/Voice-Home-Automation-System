# Description

Home Automation System is an application developed to automate home appliances through voice commands.

We are proposing a system which would help everyone to get their old wired devices on to a network and allow them to control them through a mobile app.

This system uses 
RaspberryPi which runs the server application
NodeMCU which provides wireless connectivity to wired devices
NeoPixel LEDs as a sensor to demonstrate our idea
